# Using the API

Gottaphish was designed to be API-first. This means that the UI is just a wrapper around a powerful JSON RESTful API.

You can find our API documentation [here.](https://docs.getgophish.com/api-documentation/)

## Python API Client

The Gophish team maintains an official [Python API client](https://github.com/gophish/api-client-python) for easily interacting with the API.
