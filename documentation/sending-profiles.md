# Sending Profiles

To send emails, Gottaphish requires you to set up the name who will be displayed.

It's important to make sure that your "From" address is a valid email address format.

The domain used in the email (here compte-google.com) must have been acquired before. To see the acquired domains please go to the page Campaign, click on New Campaign and see the available values in the URL field

To test your SMTP configuration, you can click the "Send Test Email" button:

&#x20;⚠️ When you send a test email, the "SMTP From" need to be at the format xxx@xxx.tld and not XX YY \<xxx@xxx.tld>.

After entering the recipient details and clicking "Send", you should see a message indicating if the email was sent successfully.
