# Advanced Dashboard (Optional)

Advanced Dashboard is a family of software consisting of a search engine and Advanced Dashboard Dashboards, a data visualization dashboard for that search engine. Designed as a community project, Advanced Dashboard was born from the split of the Elasticsearch project, which was initially a search and data analysis solution.

Advanced Dashboard is an open source, customizable and scalable search technology that provides advanced search and data analysis capabilities. With an open API, it is easy to integrate into other applications. Advanced Dashboard also benefits from an active community of developers and users, supporting its continued development.

It is also possible to see vulnerable browsers. A vulnerable browser is a web browser that may not have been updated, or that is obsolete.

You can see in the dashboard the email that was sent, the campaign description, a map to visualize where it was clicked and where the data was sent from. And the minimum delay between sending an email and submitting data. And the average time between email clicks and sending.
