# Creating the Sending Profile

Creating a sending profile is easy for this campaign. Navigate to the "Sending Profiles" page and click "New Profile".

For my campaign, I'll be sending emails from Boyd Jenius, the system administrator. I'll use his name and email address in the "From" field.

[⚠️](https://emojiterra.com/warning/) The domain used (here compte-google.com) have not been added to your account, you need to be created it before via the  _**Campaigns**_ page on your left menu. (_**Campaigns->New Campaign->URL->"click here" )**_

If you want, you can send a test email to another recipient  to ensure emails are relayed correctly.

[⚠️](https://emojiterra.com/warning/) When you send a test email, the "SMTP From" need to be at the format xxx@xxx.tld and not XX YY \<xxx@xxx.tld>.

After the settings are specified, click "Save Profile".
